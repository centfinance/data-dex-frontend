# Vana DataDex â€“ Swap & Liquidity UI

This is the official frontend for the **Vana DataDex**, a decentralized interface for swapping tokens and managing liquidity on the VANA network.

It is a fork of [Uniswap Interface v4.266.2](https://github.com/Uniswap/interface) â€” the last version that:
- Does **not include UI fee logic**
- Supports **fully local routing**

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… **Uniswap V3 core functionality**: swap, pool creation, liquidity management
- ðŸŽ¯ **VANA network integration** (RPC, token pricing, custom chain config)
- ðŸ§  **Privacy-first**: all analytics tracking and external API calls removed
- ðŸ’¡ **Local routing**: no external relayers or UniswapX dependency
- ðŸ§¼ Cleaned up: removed Uniswap-specific branding, popups, and external UX
- ðŸ›  Settings moved to a cleaner location (formerly mini portfolio)
